# Problem Statement

Prevent food waste by creating an interactive multi-channel system that will allow people with surplus excess foods from Weddings , Parties, and other events, to contact 'No Food Waste' to donate food, as well as for hungry individuals and institutions requiring food supplies to request help from 'No Food Waste'

1. Weddings
2. Parties, &
3. Other events

can contact 'No Food Waste' for donating food to the individuals, institutions in need of food. The food distribution is done for places like,

1. Orphanages
2. Homeless
3. Poor areas in the society
4. General Hospitals
5. Child care

## Solution

A mobile applicaiton on Android & iOS will enable the 3 parties to communicate in an effective manner, where
 1. Donors - people with excess food should be able to post their food availability details via the App
 2. Volunteers, Drivers - Can accept the food donation, via the app and deliver the food
 3. Volunteers - Can map the areas/places that are in need of food

Note: Delivery of food will be offline to the app.
